### Czech smoking tax : Philip Morris Study
The Philip Morris study concludes that the government gains by having Czech citizens smoke. It’s a cost/benefit analysis. Net gain if citizens smoke is  $$1147 millions. It stated that saving from premature deaths is $1,227 per person.
|  Costs      |       benefits    |
| -------------|-------------|
|Increased health care costs|Tax revenue from cigarette sales.|
| |Health care savings (from early deaths)|
| | Pension savings|
| |Savings in housing costs |


### Ford Pinto
Another example is Ford Pinto car. The car tended to erupt in flame in rear-end collisions. The company knew it and did cost/benefits analysis and concluded leaving it unfixed is better than fixing it. In one of the reports it includes a measure of the value of life, $200,000 per death.
|  Costs      |       benefits    |
| -------------|-------------|
|$$11 per part * 12.5 million cars= $137 million to improve safety|180 deaths 180 injuries  2000 vehicles = $49.5 million|

> is torture ever justified?
### case: torture a terrorist to get the location of bomb
opinions：
1. we torture so that thousands of lives will be saved (**number counts**)
2. torture seldom works , because information extracted under duress is often unreliable
3. with the use of torture ,overall utility will be reduced
**torturing a  terrorist might be acceptable , but torturing an innocent people is unacceptable because we have the idea that bad people deserve to be punished**
4. reject torture on principle, stress on human rights and dignity
