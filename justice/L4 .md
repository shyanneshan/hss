Objections to Bentham:
1. fail to respect individual rights
2. how to value
*should we value everything to a utility term. if so , why should we weight all perferences without distinguishing them into good/bad ones  or  higher/lower pleasures*
## to the second objection: how should we value
#### Banthamite utilitarians:根据数量和强度评判
+ no making qualitative distinctions
+ non-judgemental
+ egalitarian

>The quantity of pleasure being equal, pushpin is as good as poetry.
#### J.S.Mill:根据质量评判


John Stuart Mill humanizes utilitarianism, his wife is Harriet Taylor, a philosopher and women’s rights advocate. He thinks if one experiences both and prefers one, that one is the desire pleasure.
>It is better to be human being satisfied than a pig satisfied. Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their side of question.

He stays with the idea that our de facto actual empirical desires are the only basis for moral judgement.
>The sole evidence it is possible to produce that anything is desirable is that people actually do desire it.
Of two pleasures, if there be on to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, then that is the more desirable pleasure.

Strong theories of rights say individuals matter not just as instruments to be used for a larger social purpose or for the sake of maximizing utility. Individuals are separate beings with separate lives worthy of respect. So it’s a mistake to think about justice or law by just adding up preferences and values.

Mill支持自由的理由：其著作 *On Liberty* 中心原则为：
>倘若不伤害他人，人们应该可以自由地去做任何他们想做的事情
+ 一个人要对社会负责的行为只有他/她影响他人的行为
+ 个人自由的理由完全建立在功利主义的考量之上：
+ 不应当逐事地使功利最大化，而是从长远来看
+ 尊重个体自由从长远上来看，会导致最大的人类幸福 
>一个强迫其成员接受习俗和传统的社会可能会陷入一种荒谬的一致性，从而剥夺了自身的，促进社会进步的能量和活力
