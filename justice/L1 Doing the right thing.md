###### steps
1.start with an opinion, or a conviction, about the right thing to do 
>*“Turn the trolleyonto the side track.”*

2.reflect on the reason for our conviction , seek out the principle on which it is based
>*“Better to sacrifice onelife to avoid the death of many.”*

3. confronted with a situation that confounds the principle, we are pitched into confusion
>*“I thought it was always right to save as many lives as possible, and yet it seems wrong to push the man o! the bridge (or to kill the auarmed goatherds).”*

4.Facing confusion, we may revise our judgment about the right thing to do, or rethink the principle we initially espoused

5.As we encounter new situations, we move back and forth between our
judgments and our principles, revising each in light of the other.
